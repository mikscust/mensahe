To create a website with a Neo-Brutalist aesthetic using CSS, you could start by using a monochromatic color scheme, with shades of grey or another neutral color. You could also use typography that is simple and sans-serif, and consider using larger font sizes to create a bold and functional look.

In terms of layout, Neo-Brutalist websites often feature a grid-based structure, with elements arranged in a logical and orderly way. You could use CSS grid or flexbox to create this type of layout.

To add a raw, unfinished concrete texture to your website, you could use a background image or gradient that resembles concrete, or use CSS techniques such as box-shadow or text-shadow to create the illusion of depth and texture.

Here are a few examples of CSS styles you could use to create a Neo-Brutalist website:

body {
  background-color: #333;
  color: #fff;
  font-family: sans-serif;
  font-size: 16px;
}

.container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);
  grid-gap: 20px;
  margin: 0 auto;
  max-width: 1200px;
  padding: 20px;
}

.box {
  background-color: #444;
  box-shadow: 0px 0px 10px rgba(0,0,0,0.5);
  padding: 20px;
}

h1 {
  font-size: 32px;
  text-align: center;
  text-shadow: 0px 0px 10px rgba(0,0,0,0.5);
}

p {
  font-size: 18px;
  line-height: 1.5;
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
}
